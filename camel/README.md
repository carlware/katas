Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

Examples

```sh
ToCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior"); // returns "theStealthWarrior"

ToCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior"); // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
```
